# Getting Started with Create React App and Sass

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was created to learn how to use sass within a simple Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i` or `npm install`

Install project dependencies

### `npm i sass` or `npm install sass`

Install sass support for the project

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
